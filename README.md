# appleMusicIphoneClone
Apple Music website UI clone for mobile experience.

My intent for this project was to replicate the mobile experience for the Apple music website and because of that I ask that if you are viewing on desktop that you open your browser inspector, toggle on the device toolbar, and select one of the mobile device options listed.

If you are using Google Chrome as your browser option:
- right click anywhere on the site
- select "Inspect" from the menu options 
- Inspector toolbar should pop-up on the right side of the screen
- in the top left corner beside the little icon with a pointer, there is another icon with what appears to be two different sized devices
- click that icon with the two devices
- a bar should now pop up at the top of your view port and there should be a little drop down menu that once clicked will reveal a list of  devices you can view the site through
- click on any of the mobile device options

## Please find a demo video of the mobile user experience below.
